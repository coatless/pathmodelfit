Description: Compute fit indices for evaluating the path component of latent
    variable structural equation models. Available fit indices include 'RMSEA-P'
    and 'NSCI-P' originally presented and evaluated by Williams and O'Boyle (2011) 
    and demonstrated by O'Boyle and Williams (2011) and Williams, O'Boyle, & Yu (2020). 
    Also included are fit indices described by Hancock and Mueller (2011).
