Description: \code{pathmodelfit} computes fit indices for 
    evaluating the path component of latent variable structural equation models. 
    Available fit indices include RMSEA-P and NSCI-P originally presented and evaluated 
    by Williams and O'Boyle (2011) and demonstrated by O'Boyle and Williams (2011) and 
    Williams, O'Boyle, & Yu (2020). Also included are fit indices described by 
    Hancock and Mueller (2011).
